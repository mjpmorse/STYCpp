(1) If I needed a container which contains an array of ojects such taht insertion is possible at the bottom and the top I would use a deque container.

(2) If I need to store elements for a quick lookup, the optimal choice would be set or unordered_set depending on how long the list is. Set has search times which is logarithmic in length, while unordered_set has a search time which is roughly constant.

(3) No, if you need to store and access data by a value which is not necessarily the value of the data it would be best to use std:map or std::unordered_map.
(X) 

(4) Iterators link std algorithms to std containers.

(5) No, as of C++11 hash_set is not a standard implimentation, it would be ues to use unordered_set,map.
