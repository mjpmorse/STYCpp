(1) If I needed to only write to a file and not read it I would use the ofstream instead of fstream to makesure the file integerity is save.

(2) To get the entire line that is entered, use cin.getline()

(3) If we just needed to write to a file the ios_base::in would be more suitted to the job.

(4) is_open() checks to make sure the file was successfully opened. This is important to make sure things such as file path are correct.
