1) An interpreter directly takes the code in text form and executes the commands. It is slower. An compiler takes the code file and coverts it into machine language.

2) A linker takes the different object (machine language) codes produced by the compiler and resolves dependences. 

3) The steps of the normal development cycle are: write the code, colige the code into machine language, link the outputs of the compuler to construct the executable file. 

4) By supporting multi-threading and concurrent execution.
