(1) To model shapes and make sure every shape has a compulsory implementation of Area() and Print() I would define an ABC shapes which has Area() and Print() as pure virtual functions.

(2) The compiler constructs VFT only for classes in which there are virtual functions.

(3) Yes, one pure virtual function is enough to make a class an ABC.
