(1)
Write a lambda binary predicate that would help sort in decending order
[](const int &int1 , const int &int2) {return (int1 > int2);}

(2) Write a lambda function that, when used in for_each, adds a user-specified value to that in a container such as vector.

[int to_add](int &a){a = a + to_add;}
