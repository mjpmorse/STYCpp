(1) I would look in the c++ STL then the Boost.org pointer documentation

(2) A smart pointer could slow down the application significantly if it is used incorrectly. For example deep copying too much.

(3) A reference counted smart pointer keeps the count on the free store.

(4) The linked list mechanism used by reference-linked pointers should be double linked.
