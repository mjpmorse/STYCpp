(1) No, elements inserted to the end of a vector is done in constant time. Elements inserted at the beginnning or middle is linear in time.

(2) If the vector size is 10, and the allocation size is 20, 10 more elements can be inserted before needing to allocate more memory.

(3) the pop_back function removes the last element from a vector or deque.

(4) a vector <CMammal> is a dynamic vector of the CMammal class.

(5) Elements in a vector can be accessed using [], or the .at() function, or by an iterator.

(6) vector <Class>::iterator iterator can be used to randomly access an element of a vector.
(X) random access iterator
