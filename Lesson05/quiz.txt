(1) When writting a program to divide numbers it would be better to use the type float since the type int does not return the decimal data.

(2) 32/7 = 4

(3) 32.0/7 =  4 + 4./7  

(4) sizeof() is not a function but rather an operator.

(5) No the expression int result = number << 1 + 5 << 1; will not double a number, add 5 to it, then double it again as addition occur first. A better expression is int result = ((number <<1 ) + 5) << 1

(6) xOR will evalulate to false if both operands evaluate to true. xOR is exclusive-or.
