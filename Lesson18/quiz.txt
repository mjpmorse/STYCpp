(1)  No, for list inserting at the beginning or middle or end is constant in time. This is different from a vector where inserting from the beginning is constant in time but middle is linear in time.

(2)  No, iterators over lists do not go invalid when elements are inserted or removed.

(3) The constents of a list can be cleared by calling the function .clear()

(4) Yes multiple elements can be inserted into a list in a few aways since list has an over loaded constructor.
