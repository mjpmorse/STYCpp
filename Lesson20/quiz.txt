(1) If I declare a map of ints as map <int> the default sort criteria is std::less.

(2) Dulpicate items in a multimap would be found next to each other based on the sorting criteria.

(3) the map or multimap functino size() tells you the number of pairs in the container

(4) You would not find duplicate items in a map
