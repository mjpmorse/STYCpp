(1) Indentation in code is important for code readability. While c++ does not require code to be well formatted a well formatted code will help others who may read your code as well as yourself in the future.

(2) goto makes code lease readable and changes the controlled flow. This can lead to unexpected consequences, or issues in the future when others work on the code.

(3) It is possible to decrement a counter for a for loop. 
    for(counter = max_counter; counter > limit; -- counter){ };

(4) The problem with the code comes from condition on the incrementer, if the counter starts at 0, the for loop would never execute since 0 != 10. The correct code would read:
	for(counter=0; counter<=10; ++counter){
		count<<counter<< " ";
}
