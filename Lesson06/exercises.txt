(5) This code has two issues, the first is the loop will not execute as we set counter to 0, then (if written correctly) check if it is equal to 10. The second issue, which will cause the code not to compile is the conditional statement in the for loop must be a logical operator; '==' not '=' since '=' is an assignmentstatement.

(6) This code should read:
	while(loopcounter<5){
		cout << loopcounter<< " ";
		loopcounter ++;
	}
The ; after while() ends the statement.

(7) When using switch() it is important to end each case with a break command. Else the conditions will continue to be evalulated. In this case for all inputs the output "invalid input" would appear along with the specific conditions of the cases.
